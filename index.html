		<h2>1. Why travel? </h2>
		<p>There are as many reasons to travel as there are mountains to climb and sunsets to admire: to learn, to grow, to become, to breathe fresh air, to see new horizons, to dive into new depths, to hear strange words.

		Travel writer Paul Theroux claims that “...the wish to travel seems to me characteristically human: the desire to move, to satisfy your curiosity or ease your fears, to change the circumstances of your life, to be a stranger, to make a friend, to experience an exotic landscape, to risk the unknown.” </p>

		<h2>2. Tips</h2>
		<p>Patience Is Important - Wake Up Early To Avoid Crowds - Observe Daily Life Around You - Laugh At Yourself Sometimes - Slow Down To Enjoy Your Trip. </p>

		<h2>3. Traveling Sustainably</h2>
		<p>Sustainable travel begins long before we reach our destination. It's about making smarter choices in every aspect of the trip; from booking transport and accommodation to seeking out local experiences and being conscious of where we're investing our tourist dollars. For example, travel off-peak/off-beat, using road/rail instead of planes, opt for eco-conscious accommodation,  use reusable items when traveling and spend your money locally. </p>
